						,some people have the opinion that entertainment media such as video games,films and television programmes cause an increase in violence in real life.

						</div>
						,others feel that violence has always been a part of society and civilization and that the current times are no different.

						<br>
						<br>

						Sometimes video games are blamed for acts of violence. But the question is: Would these people have been thinking about violence if they were not playing video games? Inonegame, for example, the player uses a variety of guns and bombs to destroy the evil enemies;
					<div class="option">
							<input class="answer-input border-black" type="text" placeholder="Escribe tu respuesta"/>
							<div class="answer border-green">however</div>
						</div>
						,in other games the objective is to eliminate all of the players in the game. Is one more violent than the other? Do all video games cause aggressive behavior? Researchers have had a hard time proving that the behavior of a violent person would not have happened if he had not played video games.
					   <br>
					   <br>
						So, 
						<div class="option">
							<input class="answer-input border-black" type="text" placeholder="Escribe tu respuesta"/>
							<div class="answer border-green">to sum it up</div>
						</div>
						: there is no definitive evidence connecting video games to real violence.
						<br>

						A lot of research has similarly been done to see if violent films and television have an impact on children and causes them to be more aggressive. Experts say that the intensity of violent images due to computer enhanced graphics has more of an impact on children these days than films in the past have had.
						<div class="option">
							<input class="answer-input border-black" type="text" placeholder="Escribe tu respuesta"/>
							<div class="answer border-green">On the whole</div>
						</div>
						, the idea that violence creates violence cannot be defined as an acceptable theory.
