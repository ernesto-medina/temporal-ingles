					<div class="title">Animal Companions</div>
					<div class="text">
						More than half of all American households have an animal companion. These pets are actually more common than children, with 52 million dogs, 60 million cats, 40 million birds and more than 70 million small mammals and reptiles.

					<div class="text">
						This is a topic that is dear to me because

						it. My own dog is seventeen years old and he has been the best companion in the world to me.

						should have an animal companion. Now, that is not to say that having an animal companion is all happiness and perfection; however, I would say that there are more advantages than disadvantages.

							<div class="answer border-green">One huge advantage is</div>
						</div>
						that having an animal companion is good for your health. Imagine that! But it's true. Researchers have found that having an animal companion is beneficial for many people. One of the most important health benefits that pets give is protection against heart disease. Pet owners tend to have lower blood pressure and stress than people who do not own pets. An even more dramatic effect that animals have on humans is with elderly people. Many studies have shown that people who are isolated and depressed are more likely to die from their illness.

						<div class="option">

							<div class="answer border-green">The positive side</div>
						</div>
						is that people who have animal companions are more active than those who do not and are less likely to have feelings of depression.

							<div class="answer border-green">There are some disadvantages</div>
						</div>
						. Companion animals get sick, just like children, and it can be costly to provide medical treatment for your animal companion. When you own an animal companion, you have many responsibilities. Those responsibilities can have both a positive side and negative side.

					<div class="text">
						
						<div class="option">

							<div class="answer border-green">The negative side could be</div>
						</div>
						taking your dog for a walk at 4:00 in the morning when the weather is freezing. However, if you own a cat, small mammal, bird or reptile, you will not have that experience. Think carefully about how much responsibility you want to take before you decide on an animal companion.

						<div class="option">
							<input class="answer-input border-black" type="text" placeholder="Escribe tu respuesta"/>
							<div class="answer border-green">In my experience</div>
						</div>
						the positive outweighs the negative and I could never imagine not having an animal companion. My animal companion has given me lots of joy and happiness through our seventeen years together.
